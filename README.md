Pomodoro is a time management tool

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

* Few key features:
  * If the window looses focus the timer will pause to make sure you spend 25 mins not doing anything on your computer; But if you want to use your browser open a new window instead of a tab.
  * You can switch time by clicking on the minutes shown.
  * You can choose to turn sound on or off for completion of timer.
  * You can replace the *beep.mp3* file in sound folder with your custom sound file to play after the completion of timer.
